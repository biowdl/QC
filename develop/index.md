This repository contains a collection of [BioWDL](https://github.com/biowdl)
workflows which can be used for quality control preprocessing and reporting of
sequencing data. The following workflows are available:
- QC.wdl: Cuts reads using cutadapt on the basis of the quality reports produced by `QualityReport.wdl`.
- QualityReport.wdl: Uses fastqc to produce quality reports.

These workflows are part of [BioWDL](https://biowdl.github.io/)
developed by [the SASC team](http://sasc.lumc.nl/).

## Usage

`QC.wdl` can be run using
[Cromwell](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):
```
java -jar cromwell-<version>.jar run -i inputs.json QC.wdl
```

### Input

Inputs are provided through a JSON file. The minimally required inputs are
described below, but additional inputs are available.
A template containing all possible inputs can be generated using
Womtool as described in the
[WOMtool documentation](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/WOMtool/).
See [this page](/inputs.html) for some additional general notes and information
about pipeline inputs.

```JSON
{
  "QC.read1": "Path to read1"
}
```
`QC.read1`  is the only required input. In case of read pairs the reverse
read can be set with `QC.read2`. The adapters for cutadapt can be  set
with `QC.Cutadapt.adapter` and `QC.Cutadapt.adapterRead2` for read1 and
read2 respectively. If read1 and read2 use the same adapters this can be
set with `QC.Cutadapt.adapterBoth`. 

An output directory can be set using an `options.json` file. See [the 
cromwell documentation](
https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview/) for more 
information. 

Example `options.json` file:
```JSON
{
"final_workflow_outputs_dir": "my-analysis-output",
"use_relative_output_paths": true,
"default_runtime_attributes": {
  "docker_user": "$EUID"
  }
}
```
Alternatively an output directory can be set with `QC.outputDir`. 
`QC.outputDir` must be mounted in the docker container. Cromwell will
need a custom configuration to allow this.

#### Example

An example of an inputs.json might look like this:
```JSON
{
  "QC.read1":"/home/user/samples/sample_1/lib_1/rg_1/R1.fq.gz",
  "QC.read2":"/home/user/samples/sample_1/lib_1/rg_1/R2.fq.gz",
  "QC.Cutadapt.adapterBoth": ["AGATCGGAAGAG"]
}
```

Note that `adapterBoth` uses a list of strings instead of a single string. 
This is because cutadapt accepts multiple adapters.

### Dependency requirements and tool versions
Biowdl pipelines use docker images to ensure  reproducibility. This
means that biowdl pipelines will run on any system that has docker 
installed. Alternatively they can be run with singularity.

For more advanced configuration of docker or singularity please check 
the [cromwell documentation on containers](
https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/Containers/).  

Images from [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro) are preferred for 
biowdl pipelines. The list of default images for this pipeline can be 
found in the default for the `dockerImages` input. 

### Output

A new set of FASTQ files from which detected adapters have been clipped and a
set of quality reports.
